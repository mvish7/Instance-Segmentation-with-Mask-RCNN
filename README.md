# Instance Segmentation with Mask RCNN

This repository contains code implementing Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation. A pretrained Mask R-CNN model(over coco) was used.
The steps for setting up the model for inference were identical to [YOLO based object detection](https://github.com/mvish7/YOLO-based-object-detection)
